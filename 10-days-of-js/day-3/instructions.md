# Day 3 - Arrays

## Objective

In this challegne, we learn about Arrays. Check out the attached [tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-arrays/editorial) for more details

## Function Description

Complete the `getSecondLargest` function in the editor below:

**Parameters** `getSecondLargest` has the following parameters:

- Name: `nums`
- Type: `integer`
- Description represents an array of integers

**Return value**

- Type: `integer`
- Description: Second Largest integer in `nums`

**Input Format**

- The first line contains an integer, `n` the size of the `nums` array.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated numbers that describe the elements in `nums`

**Constraints**

- `n` will have a greater than or equal to `1` and less-than or equal to `10`
- `nums` will have `1` to `100` integers.
- the integers contained within `nums` may not be distinct

**Sample Input**

```
5
2 3 6 6 5
```

**Sample Output**

```
5
```

**Explanation**

Given the array `nums` equals `[2,3,6,6,5]` , we see that the largest value in the array is `6` and the second largest value is `5`. Thus, we return `5` as our answer.
